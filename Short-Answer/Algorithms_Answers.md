#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) It's O(n) because the dependence is only on the n, no matter how many times it is ran. When the input size increases the runtime will grow at the same rate.


b) Because the first loop runs O(n) and the second loop would also run times O(n).


c) It's constant O(1) because the runtime is not altered by the size of the input.
